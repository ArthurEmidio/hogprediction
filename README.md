#Vehicle Path Prediction Using HOG

This repository contains the implementation of an undergraduate research project
developed with the goal to find trajectories that a vehicle is likely to traverse
in a scene using [Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients) 
as main feature.

##Usage
Insert all frames (as .jpg images) of the input video in a folder named "input" in the same directory where
the binary is located. The frames must be numbered as: "i.jpg", where i = 0, 1, ..., N.

It is important to note that the frames should always contain the vehicle which will have the trajectory predicted.

Run the executable, select the vehicle of interest. The trajectory prediction based on the first frame will be shown.
Press any key after each iteration to visualize the next predicted trajectory.

If you're looking for a dataset of aerial videos, the [MINSK dataset](http://www.tft.lth.se/en/research/video-analysis/co-operation/data-exchange/) (Saunier et al.) is a great option.
